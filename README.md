# Deall
- Microservices architecture
- REST API
- MongoDB
- Feature: simple authN/Z n CRUD user

This repo include logout, refresh token, and redis cache.

Might be error as the containers run because I encounter ```ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:6379```

Thus, I do comment all redis related code in repo include the docker compose
